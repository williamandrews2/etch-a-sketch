# Etch-A-Sketch
## Introduction
This was a simple sketchpad created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of the Odin Project. 

## How to Use
Upon loading the page in a live server or website, click on the Etch-A-Sketch board to toggle between free-cursor mode and coloring mode. You can choose to use black ink, erase, rainbow ink, or reset the board.
There is also an input box at the bottom where you can input the grid size, for example, an input of "16" would result in a 16x16 grid. This box can accept values between 2 and 100.

## Known Issues
Currently, the only issue I am aware of is that the page is not optimized for mobile viewing.
